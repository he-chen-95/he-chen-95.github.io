## My software recommendations for PhD students

Two weeks ago, my laptop was broken down, my university arranged to repair it within a few days.  However, I have to reinstall all useful applications for thesis preparation. It's annoying. Many Ph.D. students often ask for tips on how to manage their works. At the beginning of my Ph.D., I tried out lots of different computer applications to manage my work. Here are some applications or websites I'd like to recommend to any Ph.D. student.

###### Literature search 

There are a large number of available digital tools that could help researches search the millions of published articles. Here, I list some tools that help for the literature search.

Google Scholar:  It is a popular search engine that helps researchers find scholarly literature using relevant keywords.

Sci-hub: by bypassing publisher's pay-walls, SCI-HUB provides free access to millions of research articles and books. As a researcher, I should not recommend this tool, it's not legal. But I list it here for someone who can not access the research databases from universities.  

###### Manuscript editing 

LaTeX: a high-quality typesetting system specifically designed for producing technical and scientific documentation. Also, Zotero libraries can be directly exported to BibTeX files for use with LaTeX. If you don't want to manually install and configure your Latex environment, Overleaf can be a goof replacement. Overleaf is a website which offers millions of latex templates and on-line editing service.

Math-pix: It can extract equations from PDFs or handwritten notes by taking screen-shot, and generate the resulting Latex code. I usually type my equation on MS word and then use Math-pix to generate corresponding Latex. For sure, it really saves a lot of labor work. 

Grammarly: if you are not a native English speaker, you may try out this tool, it offers grammar checking, spell checking, and plagiarism detection services along with useful suggestions. 

Typora: a Markdown editor, if you want to write some articles on your own blog, you may try it out. 

######  Reference management 

Formatting references is the most tedious of academic tasks. Reference management tools are used by researches to handle references and citations and can save you from ever doing it again. They store articles along with the references and allow a user to take some notes on. Most importantly, they can help you to format in-text citations and bibliographic references when you are composing your manuscript.  

Zotero:  It operates as an Android app, desktop program, and a Firefox plug-in. It is a free, easy-to-use tool to help you collect, organize, cite, and share research. It automatically downloads and saves the PDF version of an article that the user is reading and extracts all bibliographic information. When writing a paper in Microsoft Word, Open Office, users can easily search for and add in-text citations, which automatically appear in the bibliography. Zotero lacks the ability to annotate the PDF itself, but the author can add separate notes files, which are searchable.
